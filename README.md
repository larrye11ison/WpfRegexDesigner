# WpfRegexDesigner

WPF implementation of a Regular Expression builder/designer

When WPF first came out I wanted to find something to "force" me to learn WPF. So I picked something that 
was well beyond "Hell, World!" but still not terribly complicated. I came across software called
Rad Regex Designer (originally [here](http://www.radsoftware.com.au/regexdesigner/) but apparently not 
around any more) and I thought it worked pretty well, so I decided to use it as "inspiration" as I 
created something "fairly similar" in WPF. 

These days when I'm cobbling something together that's regex-dependent, it's generally in Powershell so I'll
just hack on it there. But this tool works pretty well, so I do use it occasionally. But there are a couple of 
weird things, esp. with the application's interface.
